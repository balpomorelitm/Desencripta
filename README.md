## Running the Decrypto Simulation

The repository includes a standalone script `decrypto.py` that implements
the core logic for a serverless version of Decrypto. You can run the
script directly with Python to see a two-round example game:

```bash
python decrypto.py
```

The script demonstrates how two devices (one for each team) keep their
state in sync using a shared game seed.
